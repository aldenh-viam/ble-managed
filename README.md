# ble-managed

Code to run a BLE-SOCKS bridge. See READMEs for socks-forwarder (rust proxy) and
phone_proxy (flutter proxy) in their respective directories.

Also see documentation for the [socks-forwarder
module](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/socks-forwarder) that interfaces with
the socks-forwarder systemd service, and the flutter-ble library leveraged by
[phone_proxy](https://github.com/viamrobotics/flutter-ble).
